# Workspace to have a GUI with buttons and cam stream
## dependancies
* ~~libuvc_camera `sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-libuvc-camera`~~
* https://github.com/ros-drivers/video_stream_opencv

## How to run?
1. Publish camera by starting publisher node
* * `roslaunch fucking_webcam webcam.launch`
2. Run GUI
* * `rosrun webcam_control_gui webcam_control_gui.py`

## Limitations
> There is a problem with dependacies, so if you are using Ubuntu, there is a chance that due to copyright stuff the icons won't appear.
> Also there is a unknown problem with buttons that make them appear on separate window (press CTRL+P for button window)
Both of this problems are result of using ROS + Python + OpenCV. But alternative software may result in longer development time.

## How to use
* start the node
* open menu (CTRL+P)
* press needed buttons
